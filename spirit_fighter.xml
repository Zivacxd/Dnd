            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to channel spirit energy into your attacks. You have a pool of four d6s, called essence dice, which you can expend to enhance your combat abilities. When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend an essence die to add it to the roll or the attack’s damage roll. You can choose to do this before or after making the attack roll, but before the effects of the attack are applied.</p>
            <p>You regain all expended essence dice when you finish a short or long rest. The size of your essence dice pool increases at higher levels: 7th level (5d6), 10th level (6d6), 15th level (7d6), and 18th level (8d6).</p>
